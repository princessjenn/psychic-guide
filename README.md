# Module 3 Challenge

## Description

I built this project so that the user can generate a password randomly on a user-friendly interface (either desktop OR mobile device), and the password generated will effectively execute accordingly. This solves needing to come up with a password that has enough strength to ensure security for the user.
Through creating this password generator, I learned how to program randomization through Javascript, calling functions so that they execute randomly out of a certain criteria of lowercase letters, uppercase letters, and special characters.

## Installation

N/A

## Usage

To begin, the user will be prompted with a listener to ask them if they want their password to include lowercase

To add a screenshot, create an `assets/images` folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative file path, add it to your README using the following syntax:

![alt text](assets/images/screenshot.png)

## Credits

List your collaborators, if any, with links to their GitHub profiles.

If you used any third-party assets that require attribution, list the creators with links to their primary web presence in this section.

If you followed tutorials, include links to those here as well.

## License

üèÜ The previous sections are the bare minimum, and your project will ultimately determine the content of this document. You might also want to consider adding the following sections.

## Badges

Badges aren't necessary, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.

## Features

If your project has a lot of features, list them here.

## How to Contribute

If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute to it, you can include guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own if you'd prefer.

## Tests

Go the extra mile and write tests for your application. Then provide examples on how to run them here.
